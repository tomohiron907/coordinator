Welcome to G-coordinator/gcoordinator
========================================

G-coordinator/gcoordinator is 3D printing G-code generation software. 

Using Python, you can make detailed specifications for modeling and printing conditions. 
There are two components:

- gcoordinator: Python library for G-code generation  
- G-coordinator: GUI application for easier utilization.

By installing the GUI app, you can generate G-code without needing a complete Python environment. 
Tasks such as modeling, previewing, and exporting G-code can be accomplished using just the gcoordinator library. 
Depending on your needs, you can choose between the library and the GUI for your workflow.
